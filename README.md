Aloha! and Welcome to the Git repository for the Terraria TKM Project.

This is a simple README file which will include some of the project guidelines
that this mod will follow.

First and foremost, we are not modding this to resale and create revenue from.
This project is primarily for fun and adding some content to the game Terraria.

Second, The code that we are working with has been decompiled from the actual 
Terraria application so if the code looks messy/out of place, its suppose to.

Third, When modifying/editing the project, please make sure you comment on what
you are doing as it helps when other developers access the project.  



Thats all for the guidelines, have fun and mod Terraria!


NOTE:  It would be nice to re-label the code since most of it doesn't make any
sense.  It may take awhile but it will be very benificial to us all in the 
future.
